## FAKE JOB POSTING

### WELCOME TO MY MACHINE LEARNING REPOSITORY


### Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent job postings. The project utilizes various machine learning models, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to classify job postings as fraudulent or legitimate based on several features.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following columns:
- Title
- Location
- Department
- Company Profile
- Description
- Requirements
- Benefits
- Required Experience
- Required Education
- Industry
- Function
- Fraudulent (Target Variable)

### Models Used
The following machine learning models are implemented in this project:
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Project Structure
The project directory is organized as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `models/`: Includes scripts for training and evaluating machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file.

### Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the appropriate directory (`notebooks/` or `src/`) to run the desired scripts or notebooks.
4. Execute the scripts or run the notebooks to train models, evaluate performance, and make predictions.
